## Implementation Notes

When creating these examples:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality, then add features
2. **Document Well**: Include comments explaining Hyperware-specific patterns
3. **Show Best Practices**: Demonstrate proper error handling, type safety
4. **Test P2P**: Ensure examples work with multiple nodes
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Build on concepts from simpler examples

Each example should include:
- Clear README with setup instructions
- Well-commented code
- UI that clearly shows P2P features
- Error handling for network issues
- Tests where applicable
